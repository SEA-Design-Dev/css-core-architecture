#css-core-architecture
A project for Code Fellows B25 by Wendy Rohwer and Sheyna Watkins

In this homework assignment, we created a webpage for a fictional South Lake Union Farmer's Market. Sheyna and Wendy collaborated on the html and css using BEM naming conventions. We also implemented GoogleMaps on our webpage.

Our images come from the free image site [morguefile.com](http://morguefile.com/)
